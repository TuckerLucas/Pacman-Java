<html>This project was initially developed in an academic context as part of a curricular unit belonging to the author's Masters degree course. The main objective was the development of a stand-alone application with a user interface which, among other functionalities, required the inclusion of a game. The selected game for this project was Pacman, which was coded in Java in its entirety with use of the Eclipse IDE. The initial development of the project was based on an already existent game present<br> online (link below). <br><br>YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@JavaGameDevelopment<br><br>The mentioned game (used as a base) was improved upon by adding (among other features) a User Interface, animations and an Artificial Intelligence system for the ghosts within the game. If you wish to consult the source code as well as the written documentation of the project please head to the GitHub link detailed below. <br><br><b>GitHub project:</b> https://github.com/TuckerLucas</html>

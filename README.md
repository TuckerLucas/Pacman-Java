## Introduction 
This project was initially developed in an academic context as part of a curricular unit belonging to my Masters degree. The main objective was the development of a standalone application with a user interface which, among other functionalities, required the inclusion of a game. Pacman was the game selected to be developed within the application, which was coded in Java in its entirety. I started this project back in 2020 but I like to come back to it every so often to improve upon it in any way I can. 

## Credits
Credits go out to the [Java Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/@JavaGameDevelopment) YouTube channel which helped me get this project started and understand the underlying basics of developing the game.

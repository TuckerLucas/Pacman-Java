## Introduction 
This project was initially developed in an academic context as part of a subject belonging to my Masters degree. The main objective was the development of a standalone application with a user interface which, among other functionalities, required the inclusion of a game. Pacman was the game selected to be developed within the application, which was coded in Java in its entirety. I started this project back in 2020 but I like to come back to it every so often to improve upon it in any way I can. 

## Features
The standalone application includes several features, such as:
* User Interface with:
  + Leaderboard panel (with player information being read and written to file);
  + Settings panel (for music and sound effect volume adjustment).
* Pacman game with:
  + 1 playable character (pacman) and 4 ghosts;
  + Portals for crossing from one side of the map to the other;
  + Metrics for tracking player score and lifes;
  + Energizers to turn the ghosts vulnerable for pacman to eat and gain bonus score;
  + Spawn box for ghosts to spawn in when eaten;
  + Animations (which apply to the characters, energizers and displayed bonus scores after eating a ghost);
  + Ghost AI for chasing pacman.

## Installation
In order to install the application, please take the following steps:
* Download the "Pacman_Installer.exe" executable file;
* In your downloads you will likely face the following message: "Pacman_Installer.exe isn't commonly downloaded. Make sure you trust Pacman_Installer.exe before you open it.". Right click on the file and click on "Keep";
* Double click on the downloaded installer file. If you are installing the app on Windows you will most likely be faced with a Windows Defender pop up message saying the following: "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.". Click on "More info" and then click on "Run anyway". This is your antivirus trying to protect your computer from malicious software as the installer is not commonly downloaded yet so it is not trusted;
* The installer will now open and you can extract the contents to where you like (by default these will be exctracted to C:\Program Files (x86)\Pacman);
* Once the contents have been extracted a shortcut will be added on your Desktop and you simply need to double click on it in order to run the application.

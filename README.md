## Introduction 
This project was initially developed in an academic context as part of a curricular unit belonging to my Masters degree. The main objective was the development of a standalone application with a user interface which, among other functionalities, required the inclusion of a game. Pacman was the game selected to be developed within the application, which was coded in Java in its entirety. I started this project back in 2020 but I like to come back to it every so often to improve upon it in any way I can. 

## Features
The standalone application includes several features, such as:
* User Interface with:
  + Username insertion menu prior to starting the game;
  + Settings menu for adjusting the game difficulty and sound enabling/disabling;
  + Project/author information menu.
* Pacman game with:
  + 1 playable character (pacman) and 4 ghosts;
  + Portals for crossing from one side of the map to the other;
  + Energizers to turn the ghosts vulnerable for pacman to eat and gain bonus score;
  + Spawn box for ghosts to spawn in when eaten;
  + Animations (which apply to the characters, energizers and displayed bonus scores after eating a ghost);
  + Ghost AI for chasing pacman.

## Coming soon
I have a list of features/bug fixes in mind which I'd like to implement in the near future to improve the project:
* Include a leaderboard in the User Interface for player ranking (currently in progress);
* Change the User Interface aesthetics to solely accept keyboard inputs so as to give it more of an arcade feel;
* Change each ghost's AI slightly so that they don't cover the exact same path when chasing pacman as not to overlap;
* Cool down period for ghosts to spend in spawn box after eaten in order to allow pacman to eat ghosts close to the spawn box without having an instant death.

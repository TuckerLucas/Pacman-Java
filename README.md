## Introduction 
This project was initially developed in an academic context as part of a subject belonging to my Masters degree. The main objective was the development of a standalone application with a user interface which, among other functionalities, required the inclusion of a game. Pacman was the game selected to be developed within the application, which was coded in Java in its entirety. I started this project back in 2020 but I like to come back to it every so often to improve upon it in any way I can. 

## Features
The standalone application includes several features, such as:
* User Interface with:
  + Leaderboard panel (with player information being read and written to file);
  + Settings panel (for music and sound effect volume adjustment).
* Pacman game with:
  + 1 playable character (pacman) and 4 ghosts;
  + Portals for crossing from one side of the map to the other;
  + Metrics for tracking player score and lifes;
  + Energizers to turn the ghosts vulnerable for pacman to eat and gain bonus score;
  + Spawn box for ghosts to spawn in when eaten;
  + Animations (which apply to the characters, energizers and displayed bonus scores after eating a ghost);
  + Ghost AI for chasing pacman.

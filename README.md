## Introduction 
This project was initially developed in an academic context as part of a curricular unit belonging to my Masters degree. The main objective was the development of a standalone application with a user interface which, among other functionalities, required the inclusion of a game. Pacman was the game selected to be developed within the application, which was coded in Java in its entirety. I started this project back in 2020 but I like to come back to it every so often to improve upon it in any way I can. 

## Features
The standalone application includes several features, such as:
* User Interface with:
  + Username insertion menu prior to starting the game;
  + Settings menu for adjusting the game difficulty and sound enabling/disabling;
  + Project/author information menu. 
* Pacman game with:
  + 5 characters (pacman and 4 ghosts);
  + Portals for crossing from one side of the map to the other;
  + Energizers to turn the ghosts vulnerable for pacman to eat and gain bonus score;
  + Animations (which apply to the characters, energizers and displayed bonus scores after eating a ghost);
